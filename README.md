#  Atmospheric Water Generator using VCRS Cycle  


## 🔍 Project Overview  

The **Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG)** is designed to extract water from humid atmospheric air using the **Vapor Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS)**.  
This project aims to address water scarcity issues by developing a sustainable, energy-efficient solution that produces clean, drinkable water from the environment.

The system operates on the principle of cooling humid air below its dew point, causing water vapor to condense on the evaporator surface. The condensed water is then collected and filtered for use.

## ⚙️ Working Principle  

1. **Air Intake:** Humid atmospheric air is drawn into the system.  
2. **Cooling Process:** Air passes over the evaporator coils of the VCRS, where it is cooled below its dew point.  
3. **Condensation:** Water vapor condenses on the cooled surface and is collected as liquid water.  
4. **Filtration & Storage:** The condensed water is filtered and stored for later use.  
5. **Refrigeration Cycle:** The cycle continues with the refrigerant circulating through the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator.
